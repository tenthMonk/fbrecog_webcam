This repo is an improvement over [fbrecog](https://github.com/samj1912/fbrecog) with an added feature of input from webcam using opencv

This is just a reminder for me:

* Opencv lives in a conda env called cv
* activate it by
* source activate cv

You've got to be Facebook friends with person you are running the face recog test on.
